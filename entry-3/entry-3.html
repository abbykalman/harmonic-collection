<h4> 
	We created this site as a safe space to discuss what the impacts of empathy and the feelings of mutuality have on the human experience. The goal here is for a sense of unity; for people to understand that we all experience similar things, share similar memories, and to investigate unique ways in which we as humans connect symbiotically. With viewing each entry, we hope that you feel a sense of empathy to the experiences your viewing, reflect on your own memories and emotions of empathy, and to become aware in your human experience. Welcome home, <strong>we made this for you</strong>.
