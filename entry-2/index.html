    <h1>Here's a Playlist I Made for You...</h1>
    <p> I find that making someone a playlist is extremely thoughtful and songs bring people together in important moments. I sent a google form out to a group of people with the following: 
      </p>
      <h2> <strong> <marquee>What is a song that reminds you of a time you experienced 
        empathy, human connection, or a time 
        in which you felt empathetic towards another person? </marquee>
        </strong></h2>
