  <div class="container">
    
    <p> I find that making someone a playlist is extremely thoughtful and songs bring people together in important moments. I sent a google form out to a group of people with the following question:</p>
    <h2>
      <marquee>What is a song that reminds you of a time you experienced empathy, human connection, or a time in which you felt empathetic towards another person? </marquee>
    </h2>
    <h3>I hoped that understanding a special song of my friends would bring me <strong>closer</strong> to them on a deeper level and <strong>understand their experiences.</strong> With this question from the google form, I compiled a playlist seen below.</h3>
