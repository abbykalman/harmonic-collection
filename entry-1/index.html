	Has a friend ever confided in you and it brought you to tears because their words resonated too well with you? Have you ever sat under the stars with someone at night, conversing about your hopes and aspirations, and although different, you both have a common feeling of being eager to see one another prosper? It goes without saying that human connection is impossible without an idea of being able to understand one another. For my Harmonic Collection, I chose the theme of Empathy as I am a person who relies heavily on shared experiences, and how those experiences are impactful on others. Within the theme of Empathy, I want each entry to be an investigation of Empathy’s impact on people dependent on the situation. In other words, I think it would be interesting to do something as simple as a spotify playlist curated of songs my friends claim remind them of an empathetic moment that shaped them, or find old letters of admiration at a flea market and hold a digital archive of notes from strangers. Formally speaking, I want the colors and aesthetic to feed into this idea of  impact and evoke a feeling of a safe space. This would include warmer and brighter colors, such as whites, oranges, and yellows. I start my theme off with entry one; an interview with my mother, as that is how we all begin. The amount of empathy we as people have is measured by our childhood experiences, which is usually fueled by the actions of a Mother. My ultimate goal is for others to understand their impact on one another, by creating a communicative and safe space as I feel conversations such as these deserve more limelight. -->

     <h2 style="color: coral;">AK: To begin, if you had to define empathy, how would you describe it?</h2><br>
     <p>
        <u>JK:</u> Knowing the same feeling someone might be having because you experienced it yourself.

    <h2 style="color: coral;">AK: Do you feel that moments of empathy and a shared experience among others are important? If so, do you feel we in society should talk about our shared experiences more in order to create a safe space?</h2><br>
    <p>
        <u>JK</u>: Very important. <strong>In fact critical to human relationships</strong>. Yes - talking about them gives an opportunity for people to connect and understand one another.

    <h2 style="color: coral;">AK: As a mother, do you think having children has changed your perception of empathy? Do you think it has made you more deeply empathetic to not only your family, but other people around you?
    </h2><br>
    <p>
        <u>JK</u>: Yes. Having children is a common bond with other parents and being a mother provides an entirely different layer of perspective on the human condition. <strong>You can relate to other human beings as “a mother” and feel something common even in people you don’t know and may never meet</strong>. You can also relate to the feelings of motherhood with other mothers and be part of a community to support them because of your understanding of their emotions.

    <h2 style="color: coral;">AK: What is a powerful moment where you felt empathetic towards someone, or you realized that someone was being empathetic towards you?
    </h2><br>
    <p>
        <u>JK</u>: I experienced great empathy with a friend who’s child attempted suicide. <strong>As a mother you can’t help but feel that on a very deep and powerful level</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color: coral;">AK: What values did you instill in your children that you believe made them empathetic people? Would you consider this answer advice for other parents? Do you think it’s important to instill values within your children that allow them to become empathetic?</h2><br>
    <p>
        <u>JK</u>: <strong>I taught you kids to care about others and be kind to others</strong>. And yes I think that leads to being empathetic and I think empathy is a key trait of a healthy personality.

    <h2 style="color: coral;">AK: What do you think is the relationship between a mother and child in conjunction with empathy?</h2><br>
    <p>
        <u>JK</u>: I think a mother can relate to many things a child goes through because she was once a child herself and went through similar experiences. <strong>This provides the mother with a guide to assist the child but really allows her to be able to relate to that child</strong>. You need to have empathy to guide, develop and grow another human being.

    <h2 style="color: coral;">AK: If any final thoughts, comments, or questions on anything discussed, whether that be empathy, human connection, shared experience, and your overall experiences and lessons you’ve had, feel free to add below. 
    </h2><br>
    <p><u>JK</u>: We probably currently live in a time where 1:1 in-person human connection is at its lowest point. Empathy is at risk due to this phenomenon. <strong>It’s critical to “walk in someone else’s shoes” and understand them for human connection</strong>.</p>
